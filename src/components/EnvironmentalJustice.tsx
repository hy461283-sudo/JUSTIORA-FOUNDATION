            Environmental justice lies at the core of Justiora Foundation's mission and values. The foundation believes that a healthy environment is not a privilege, but a fundamental human right, and that environmental degradation disproportionately affects marginalized, low-income, and vulnerable communities. Through its environmental justice initiatives, Justiora Foundation works to bridge the gap between environmental protection and social equity, ensuring that no community is left behind in the pursuit of sustainable development.

              Understanding Environmental Justice
            </h3>
            <p className="text-base text-[#2c1810] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Environmental justice, as championed by Justiora Foundation, refers to the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people—regardless of socio-economic status, geography, gender, or background—in environmental decision-making. The foundation recognizes that communities with fewer resources often face the highest exposure to pollution, unsafe water, climate risks, and environmental neglect, while having the least access to legal remedies and institutional support.

            <p className="text-base text-[#2c1810] leading-relaxed">
              Justiora Foundation addresses these imbalances by combining advocacy, community engagement, education, and on-ground action to protect both people and the ecosystems they depend upon.
